# -responsive-landing-page-using-html-css-js
In this project i created a simple and responsive landing page. The landing page that we are going to create will have a side navigation menu that is fully responsive for both large screen and mobile devices. For creating a navigation menu i used pure JavaScript (just a few lines of code).
